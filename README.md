# Bullet Journeling

## Set up

1. The Index
  * Dedicate the first 4-6 pages for indexing all future pages. 
  * When you add a new entry, index it.
  * Tip: only index what you will reference later.

2. The Future Log
  * Only needs one or two spreads (4 pages).
  * Think of this as the 6-month or year view.
  * Check it on a monthly basis to fill monthly log
  
3. The Month Long
  * Left side: list all 28 days in a three column manner: number, name, and events. E.g., |#|d|-------------------|
  * Right side: master task list. This is a good place to store those big things that need to get done, perhaps a few weeks ahead.
  * Add page numbers
  * Add 'Spread' to your index
  * Tip: Log notable snippets you would like to look back on as memories on your calendar page.

4. The Day to Day
  * Start each day with some date designation on the top left. I do "MM/DD/YYYY Friday".
  * At the end of that day, draw a line beneath the last line and prepare the next day.
  * Start an entry for today.

## Symbols and Signifiers

Visually manage your data.
Organize what you write with bullets
Give bullets context with signifiers

* Use a '•' for a task
  * Turn a '•' to an 'X' when you finish that task.
  * Turn a '•' to a '>' if you have to 'migrate' it the next (or another) day.
  * Turn a '•' to a '<' if it becomes a scheduled event.
* Use a '—' for a note
* Use a '○' for an event

In the margins:
* Use '*' for priority
* Use an '!' to designate importance
* Use an '👁' to designate an idea or topic to research
* Use an '♥' to designate Favorite/liked
* use '★' to designate Important
* Use '➰' to designate Recurring
