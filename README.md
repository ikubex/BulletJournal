# Bullet Journeling

## Set up

1. The Index
  * Dedicate the first 4-6 pages for indexing all future pages. 

2. The Future Log
  * Only needs one or two spreads, depending on your preference. Think of this as the 6-month or year view.
  
3. The Month Spread
  * Left side: list all 28 days in a three column manner: number, name, and events. E.g., |#|d|-------------------|
  * Right side: master task list. This is a good place to store those big things that need to get done, perhaps a few weeks ahead.
  * Add page numbers
  * Add 'Spread' to your index

4. The Day to Day
  * Start each day with some date designation on the top left. I do "MM/DD/YYYY Friday".
  * At the end of that day, draw a line beneath the last line and prepare the next day.
  * Start an entry for today.
